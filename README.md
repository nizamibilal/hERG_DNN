Train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for predicting the hERG liability of a molecule. 
In this tutorial we will develop a Deep Neural Network model for predicting the hERG activity of chemical compounds.  We will be using Keras with TensorFlow back end to train the DNN model. 

Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. 
We will be running the python codes in a Jupyter notebooks.    

### Background
hERG (the human Ether-Ã -go-go-Related Gene) is a gene that codes for a protein KV11.1, the alpha sub-unit of a potassium ion channel. This ion channel (sometimes simply denoted as 'hERG') is best known for its contribution to the electrical activity of the heart. When this channel's ability to conduct electrical current across the cell membrane is blocked, either by drugs or by rare mutations it can result in long QT syndrome. Which leads to potentially life-threatening arrhythmia.
